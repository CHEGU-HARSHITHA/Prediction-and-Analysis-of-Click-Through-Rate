# Prediction-and-Analysis-of-Click-Through-Rate

Click-through rate is the ratio of users who click on a specific link to the number of total users who view a page, email, or advertisement. For an advertising agency, predicting profitable users who are more likely to acknowledge targeted advertisements plays a prominent role. The commercial value of promotions on the web depends on how users react to them and a user response to these advertisements is beneficial to the company so that they can analyze and choose the advertisements which are more relevant to the users.

We surf through several websites everyday to get the usual information and experience a lot of ads in almost every website, questioning how these ads are profitable to the advertising agencies and on what basis these are being recommended to the users. So based on this I have worked on a model to benchmark accurate machine learning algorithms for click through rate estimation.

Therefore click through rate is an important metric for evaluating the performance of advertisements resulting in ad click prediction systems being essential and widely used for sponsored search. Hence the advertising companies might attract users who will respond to the ads.
